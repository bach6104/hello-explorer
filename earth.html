      <h1>Earth</h1>
      <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known astronomical object that harbors life. With its diverse ecosystems, Earth supports millions of species, including humans, thanks to its protective atmosphere, abundant water, and moderate temperatures. Often referred to as the "Blue Planet," Earthâ€™s surface is 70% water, creating a vibrant environment where life thrives. Its dynamic systems, including weather patterns, plate tectonics, and a magnetic field, make Earth a uniquely active planet in the solar system.</p>
