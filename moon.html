      <h1>Moon</h1>
      <p>The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is a key figure in both science and culture. Measuring about one-fourth the diameter of Earth, the Moon has a significant influence on Earth's tides, stabilizing its axial tilt and creating predictable lunar cycles. Its barren surface is marked by craters, valleys, and ancient volcanic plains, providing clues about the solar system's early history. For centuries, the Moon has inspired humanity's imagination, serving as a symbol in mythology, art, and exploration, and was famously visited during NASAâ€™s Apollo missions in the 20th century.</p>
